# Covid19-DeathPredictor
This is a question for a college course assignment. This includes both linear and quadratic fits derived from linear regression over time.

QUESTION- Download the COVID -19 data of India for the month of May, 2021 and design a predictor for the number of deaths on a particular day. Hence, predict the number of deaths on April 20, 2021 and June 10th , 2021. Verify your prediction with the actual number of deaths and hence calculate the accuracy of prediction.

[Hints: collect data from my website or from the web for the month of May, 2021. Use 22 days data for training and rest 09 days data for testing. Use both straight line fitting and quadratic curve fitting for predictor design and compare their performance in predicting accuracy]
